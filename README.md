# Hangman
Hangman is a classic guessing game. The application randomly picks a word, phrase, or sentence and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within six incorrect guesses. 

# How to play
Open the words.txt file and optionally add some new words to the game. Then, run Hangman.exe and try to guess the word! If you have Python 3 installed, you can alternatively run Hangman.py with Python.

# This application
This Python application was built so I could familiarise myself with basic Python syntax and simple operations. I had fun making it, and I hope you try it out!
